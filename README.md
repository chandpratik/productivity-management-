# ðŸ›  Set Up for firebase

1. Create a Firebase project in the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase console</a>, click Add project, then follow the on-screen instructions to create a Firebase project or to add Firebase services to an existing GCP project.

2) Navigate to the Database section of the Firebase console. You'll be prompted to select an existing Firebase project. Follow the database creation workflow.
3) Select a starting mode for your Firebase Security Rules:

   - Test mode

     Good for getting started with the mobile and web client libraries, but allows anyone to read and overwrite your data. After testing, **make sure to review the [Understand Firebase Realtime Database Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security) section.**
     To get started with the web, iOS, or Android SDK, select test mode.

   - Locked mode

     Denies all reads and writes from mobile and web clients. Your authenticated application servers can still access your database.

4.  Click **Done**.

When you enable Realtime Database, it also enables the API in the [Cloud API Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/apis/api/firebasedatabase.googleapis.com/overview).

## Firebase config object

To initialize Firebase in your app, you need to provide your app's Firebase project configuration.

```
import  firebase  from  "firebase/app";
import  "firebase/firestore";

const  firebaseConfig = firebase.initializeApp({
apiKey:  "API-KEY",
authDomain:  ""project-id.firebaseapp.com"",
databaseURL:  "https://project-id.firebaseio.com",
projectId:  "project-id",
storageBucket:  "project-id.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId:  "sender-id",
appId:  "app-id",
measurementId:  "G-measurement-id",
});

export { firebaseConfig  as  firebase };
```
